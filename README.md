#Sorting Suite

Sorting suite is a small individual project at Turing in which we considered Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, and Insertion Sort. The objective of this project was to gain understanding of the four algorithms and to demonstrate the benefits of efficient data sorting. There was no user interface for this project.
